### Hi, I'm Stephen! 

Iâ€™m a full-stack software engineer and digital project director inspired by building products clients love. With 10+ years working in creative technologies as both the client facing and project management lead, Iâ€™ve learned that aligning the goals of technical, creative, and business teams is the proven route to success.  I bring a warm engaging manner and a zest for creative solutions to any team I work on.  As a software developer, I'm passionately interested in developing software within a collaborative team that drives client success. 

I'm currently working on Python and Django.
